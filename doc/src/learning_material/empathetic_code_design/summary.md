# Summary

How do we communicate clearly in code?

* Consistency between the conceptual model and the written code.
* Make use of type safety with strong types.
* When we require something of the developer, make it easy to be provided.
* Prefer errors at compile time than runtime.
* Error messages should show what is wrong and how to fix it.
