# Summary

How do we communicate clearly in code?

* Consistency between the conceptual model and the written code.
* Make use of type safety with strong types.
* When we require something of the developer, make it easy to be provided.
* Error messages at compile time should be clear.
* Error messages at runtime should be clear.
