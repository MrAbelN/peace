# Purpose <!-- why create the framework -->

The purpose of the Peace framework is to bring people joy and peace of mind in automation development and usage. This is an active effort to take away mental and emotional stress and frustration experienced with software.

For maintainers, Peace aims to guide developers to build and support resilient automation.

For users, Peace aims to make automation *work surprisingly well*, and reduce the feeling of being lost or frustrated when things don't go according to plan.
