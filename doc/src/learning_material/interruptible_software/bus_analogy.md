1. Imagine you're taking the bus to work, and you left your phone at home.
2. Some of you don't have to imagine.
3. There are 3 points where you may realize that you don't have your phone:

    1. Before you get on the bus.
    2. While you are on the bus.
    3. After you get off the bus.

4. If you're not on the bus, that is, before you get on, or after you get off, it's safe to go and look for your phone.
5. But if you are on the bus, it is not safe to "just get off" -- it is moving.
6. To get off safely, the bus has to stop.
7. An interruption is when you signal the bus to stop.
8. And we do this by pressing the stop button, and waiting for it to stop, and then we get off.
9. You don't just press the button, and jump off without waiting for the bus to stop. I have yet to see anyone do this.
10. Software that is not interruptible, is like a bus with only two stops -- the start and end.
11. So interrupting this kind of software is like jumping off the bus, as it is moving.
11. *Interruptible software* is introducing bus stops, and the stop button to the software.
12. So people *can* press a button, wait for it to stop, and get off safely.
