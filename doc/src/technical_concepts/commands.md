# Commands

Commands in Peace are categorized based on how they interact with a *workspace*. Make sure you understand the [Peace workspace model](workspace.md).

The information available within a command execution is called the **command context**. Depending on the scope of a command, the available information changes. Peace's command API adaptively exposes methods that are relevant to the chosen scope.

This section covers:

* **Scopes:** What information is accessible for each command scope.
* **Use Cases:** Which scope to use and how to create different kinds of commands.
