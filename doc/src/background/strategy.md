# Strategy <!-- what is targeted, what value is gained -->

## Output Dimensions

The main priority is to take care of people. This is correlated to the following measurable dimensions:

* Time optimization
* Effort optimization
* Cost optimization
* Decision making

If these outputs trend in a favourable direction, then surveying people's well-being and satisfaction should show similar outcomes.


## Input Dimensions

The following input dimensions are considered when designing the Peace framework:

* **Correctness:** Take the best action, in success and in err.
* **Visibility:** Show the user what will happen, is happening, and has happened.
* **Understandability:** Show what is important. Don't overwhelm the user.
* **Recoverability:** Continue where the work was stopped.
* **Approach:** Choose the right method.
* **Performance:** Use resources efficiently to execute the approach.
* **Psychology:** Design for how people behave.

By keeping these dimensions in mind:

* For development, the framework gives people confidence that what they build is of quality, by guiding them to consider and handle cases commonly experienced by users. Through feature gates, developers are protected from mental overload by allowing parts of the automation to be developed incrementally, without risk of diverging from the ideal.

* For users, the framework provides tools to observe the state and have predictable outcomes, so that they can be confident in making decisions. It also lowers the chances and cost of failure. This reduces the fear of making mistakes, as the effort of recovery is also lowered.

* From a business perspective, increased morale, increased performance, and decreased wastage are all benefits that allow results to be achieved faster and in a reliable manner.
