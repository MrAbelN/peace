# Introduction
<p>This book describes the purpose of the <em>Peace</em> automation framework, and concepts used in its design.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-read-this-book">How To Read This Book</a></h2>
<p>Depending on your frame of mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong> – Show me the framework in action:</p>
<p>Have a play with the live <a href="examples.html">Examples</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why</strong> – Show me the rationale guiding the decisions:</p>
<p>Head on through to the <a href="background.html">Background</a> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How</strong> – Show me how it works:</p>
<p>Jump to <a href="technical_concepts.html">Technical Concepts</a>.</p>
<p>This is essential reading for framework consumers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h1>
<p>Automation, like most subjects, has many questions to ask and answer. The following is a selection of issues that are common in this space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before running the automation:
<ul>
<li>What is the current state?</li>
<li>What will the automation do?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When it is running:
<ul>
<li>Where is it up to?</li>
<li>When will things be complete?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When it errs:
<ul>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>Must I begin from scratch again?</li>
<li>How can I solve this myself?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When it completes successfully:
<ul>
<li>Can I see a report of what's changed?</li>
<li>Can it send a notification?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the responsibility and weight of these questions is placed on automation teams. Issues that originate from many separate systems surface through the automation, and are often reported to the automation team, potentially resulting in burnout.</p>
<p>For users, it is frustrating when it is difficult to understand what the automation is doing, where one is in the process, and how long it takes. This is amplified when the process errs after a lot of waiting – if it ever ends. Can one recover from errors, or end up feeling lost?</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, pressure, and expectation, have a little.. <em>peace</em> ✌️.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose <!-- why create the framework --></a></h1>
<p>The purpose of the Peace framework is to bring people joy and peace of mind in automation development and usage. This is an active effort to take away mental and emotional stress and frustration experienced with software.</p>
<p>For maintainers, Peace aims to guide developers to build and support resilient automation.</p>
<p>For users, Peace aims to make automation <em>work surprisingly well</em>, and reduce the feeling of being lost or frustrated when things don't go according to plan.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="strategy"><a class="header" href="#strategy">Strategy <!-- what is targeted, what value is gained --></a></h1>
<h2 id="outcomes"><a class="header" href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a></h2>
<p>The main priority is to take care of people. This is correlated to the following measurable dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time optimization</li>
<li>Effort optimization</li>
<li>Cost optimization</li>
<li>Decision making</li>
</ul>
<p>If these outputs trend in a favourable direction, then surveying people's well-being and satisfaction should show similar outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="input-dimensions"><a class="header" href="#input-dimensions">Input Dimensions</a></h2>
<p>The following input dimensions are considered when designing the Peace framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Choose an optimal method.</li>
<li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Take the right action, in success and in err.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Show the user what will happen, is happening, and has happened.</li>
<li><strong>Understandability:</strong> Show what is important. Don't overwhelm the user.</li>
<li><strong>Recoverability:</strong> Continue where the work was stopped.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Use resources efficiently to execute the approach.</li>
<li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Design for how people behave.</li>
</ul>
<p>By keeping these dimensions in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For development, the framework gives people confidence that what they build is of quality, by guiding them to consider and handle cases commonly experienced by users. Through feature gates, developers are protected from mental overload by allowing parts of the automation to be developed incrementally, without risk of diverging from the ideal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For users, the framework provides tools to observe the state and have predictable outcomes, so that they can be confident in making decisions. It also lowers the chances and cost of failure. This reduces the fear of making mistakes, as the effort of recovery is also lowered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a business perspective, increased morale, increased performance, and decreased wastage are all benefits that allow results to be achieved faster and in a reliable manner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ## Method: how each dimension is addressed -->
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h1>
<p>Each page in this section demonstrates the examples compiled as WASM applications.</p>
<p>If you are running this book locally, you may compile all examples before visiting the pages using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">for example in $(ls examples)
do wasm-pack build \
  --target web \
  --out-dir "../../doc/src/examples/pkg" \
  --release \
  "examples/${example}"

<p>In Peace, <a href="https://docs.rs/peace_resources/latest/peace_resources/struct.Resources.html"><code>Resources</code></a> refers to an <em>any-map</em> – a map that can store one value of different types – whose borrowing rules are checked per entry at runtime, instead of compile time.</p>
<p>Example of an any-map:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Key</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>TypeId::of::&lt;u32&gt;()</code></td><td><code>1u32</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TypeId::of::&lt;bool&gt;()</code></td><td><code>true</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TypeId::of::&lt;A&gt;()</code></td><td><code>A { value: 1u32 }</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<pre><code class="language-rust  edition2021 ignore"><span class="boring">use peace::resources::Resources;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>let mut resources = Resources::new();
resources.insert(1u32);
resources.insert(2u64);

// Change `resources` to be immutable.
let resources = resources;

// We can validly have two mutable borrows
// from the map!
let mut a = resources.borrow_mut::&lt;u32&gt;();
let mut b = resources.borrow_mut::&lt;u64&gt;();
*a = 2;
*b = 3;

// Accessing the same value while it is already
// mutably borrowed returns an error.
assert!(resources.try_borrow::&lt;u32&gt;().is_err())</code></pre>
<p>For more information about the underlying type, see <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/resman"><code>resman</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="java-equivalent"><a class="header" href="#java-equivalent">Java Equivalent</a></h2>
<p>The conceptual Java equivalent looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var resources = new MagicMap(); // new HashMap&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;, Object&gt;();
resources.insert((Integer) 1);  // innerMap.put(Integer.class, 1);
resources.insert((Long)    2);  // innerMap.put(Long.class,    2L);

var anInt = (Integer) resources.get(Integer.class);
var aLong = (Long)    resources.get(Long.class);

// Can mutate both.
anInt = 2;
aLong = 3L;
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's does not allow access to multiple mutable entries at the same time with the built in <code>HashMap</code>, so <code>Resources</code> is an implementation to bypass the compilation strictness.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="function-graph"><a class="header" href="#function-graph">Function Graph</a></h1>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/fn_graph"><code>fn_graph</code></a> is a data structure that holds functions, tracks their dependencies, and streams the functions in dependency order.</p>
<p>This is the basis of a framework that enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer provided logic and data.</li>
<li>Framework controlled invocation of logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>When consumers can plug in their logic and data to the framework, control now resides with the framework on invoking that logic and presenting the data in a goal form.</p>
<h2 id="scenario"><a class="header" href="#scenario">Scenario</a></h2>
<p>Consider the following program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize two inputs, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and two outputs <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>.</li>
<li>Add <code>a</code> to <code>c</code>.</li>
<li>Add <code>b</code> to <code>c</code>.</li>
<li>Add <code>c</code> to <code>d</code>.</li>
<li>Print the values of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="static-representation"><a class="header" href="#static-representation">Static Representation</a></h3>

<h2 id="how-it-works"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works">How It Works</a></h2>
<p>The remainder of this section shows how <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/fn_graph"><code>fn_graph</code></a> is implemented.</p>
<p>Generic data storage and dynamic access is already solved by <a href="technical_concepts/resources.html"><code>Resources</code></a> from the previous page. The remaining parts to solve all relate to the logic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Abstraction over different logic types to retrieve parameters and invoke the logic.</li>
<li><strong>Ordering:</strong> Sort logic by their dependencies and how they access data.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming:</strong> Concurrently stream logic once they are available without violating data access rules.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="abstraction"><a class="header" href="#abstraction">Abstraction</a></h1>
<p>To abstract over the logic, the following needs to be solved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> Single type to be held together in a collection.</li>
<li><strong>Instantiation:</strong> Easy to instantiate from functions or closures.</li>
<li><strong>Invocation:</strong> Able to be invoked with <a href="https://docs.rs/resman/latest/resman/struct.Resources.html"><code>Resources</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept applies to function with any number of parameters<sup>1</sup>; the code snippets on this page shows implementations for a function with 2 parameters – one mutable parameter, and one immutable parameter.</p>
<h2 id="storage"><a class="header" href="#storage">Storage</a></h2>
<p>We can store different types under a single abstraction by defining a trait, and implementing the trait for each of those different types.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">// Intermediate type so that traits can be implemented on this.
pub struct FnResource&lt;Fun, Ret, Args&gt; {
    pub func: Fun,
    marker: PhantomData&lt;(Fun, Ret, Args)&gt;,
}

// Implement `FnRes` for `FnResource` with different type parameters.

where
    Fun: Fn(&amp;mut C, &amp;A) -&gt; Ret + 'static,
    Ret: 'static,
{
    // ..
}</code></pre>
<p>Once a function or closure is wrapped in a <a href="https://docs.rs/resman/latest/resman/struct.FnResource.html"><code>FnResource</code></a>, then we can hold different functions and closures as <code>Box&lt;dyn FnRes&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="instantiation"><a class="header" href="#instantiation">Instantiation</a></h2>
<p>To make it easy to transform functions and closures into <code>Box&lt;dyn FnRes&gt;</code>, the <code>IntoFnResource</code> and <code>IntoFnRes</code> traits are provided generically:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">// Turns a function or closure into the `FnResource` wrapper type.
impl&lt;Fun, Ret, C, A&gt; IntoFnResource&lt;Fun, Ret, (&amp;mut C, &amp;A)&gt; for Fun
where
    Fun: Fn(&amp;mut C, &amp;A) -&gt; Ret + 'static,
    Ret: 'static,
{
    fn into_fn_resource(self) -&gt; FnResource&lt;Fun, Ret, (&amp;mut C, &amp;A)&gt; {
        FnResource {
            func: self,
            marker: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}

// Turns a function or closure into a `Box&lt;dyn FnRes&gt;`
impl&lt;Fun, Ret, C, A&gt; IntoFnRes&lt;Fun, Ret, (&amp;mut C, &amp;A)&gt; for Fun
where
    Fun: Fn(&amp;mut C, &amp;A) -&gt; Ret + 'static,
    Ret: 'static,
    A: 'static,
    B: 'static,
    FnResource&lt;Fun, Ret, (&amp;mut C, &amp;A)&gt;: FnRes&lt;Ret = Ret&gt;,
{
    fn into_fn_res(self) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn FnRes&lt;Ret = Ret&gt;&gt; {
        Box::new(self.into_fn_resource())
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let fn_res = (|c: &amp;mut u32, a: &amp;u32| *c += *a).into_fn_res();</code></pre>
<h2 id="invocation"><a class="header" href="#invocation">Invocation</a></h2>
<p>Now that we can easily hold different types under the <code>Box&lt;dyn FnRes&gt;</code> abstraction, the remaining issue is to invoke the logic through that common abstraction.</p>
<p>To do this, <code>FnRes</code> has a method that takes a <code>&amp;Resources</code> parameter, and each trait implementation will handle parameter fetching and function invocation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">// Trait for all logic types to implement.
pub trait FnRes {
    /// Return type of the function.
    type Ret;

    /// Runs the function.
    fn call(&amp;self, resources: &amp;Resources) -&gt; Self::Ret;
}

// Implementation to fetch the parameters from `Resources`, and invoke the function.
impl&lt;Fun, Ret, C, A&gt; FnRes for FnResource&lt;F, Ret, (&amp;mut C, &amp;A)&gt;
where
    Fun: Fn(&amp;mut C, &amp;A) -&gt; Ret + 'static,
    Ret: 'static,
{
    pub fn call(&amp;self, resources: &amp;Resources) -&gt; Ret {
        let c = resources.borrow_mut::&lt;C&gt;();
        let a = resources.borrow::&lt;A&gt;();

        (self.func)(c, a)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>With this, consumers are able to invoke functions generically:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let mut resources = Resources::new();
resources.insert(A::new(1));
resources.insert(C::new(0));

let fn_res: Box&lt;dyn FnRes&gt; = (|c: &amp;mut C, a: &amp;A| *c += *a).into_fn_res();

// Generically invoke logic with generic data type.
fn_res.call(&amp;resources);</code></pre>
<p>Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters must be <code>&amp;T</code> or <code>&amp;mut T</code>, as <code>T</code> is owned by <a href="https://docs.rs/resman/latest/resman/struct.Resources.html"><code>Resources</code></a>.</li>
<li>Parameters must be distinct types, as it is invalid to borrow <code>&amp;mut T</code> twice.</li>
<li>Borrowing and invocation is implemented by the function type – <code>FnResource</code> in this example. Out of the box, this lives in the <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/resman"><code>resman</code></a> crate instead of <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/fn_graph"><code>fn_graph</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup> <code>resman</code> implements <a href="https://docs.rs/resman/latest/resman/trait.FnRes.html"><code>FnRes</code></a> for functions with up to 6 parameters.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ordering"><a class="header" href="#ordering">Ordering</a></h1>
<p>To define the order of execution, <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/fn_graph"><code>fn_graph</code></a> uses two kinds of dependencies – logical and data. Logical dependencies are defined by consumers of the crate. Data dependencies are calculated by inspecting the type and mutability of function parameters.</p>
<p>Using the example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">type Fn1 = fn(&amp;mut i32, &amp;mut i32, &amp;mut i32, &amp;mut i32);
</span><span class="boring">type Fn2 = fn(&amp;i32, &amp;mut i32);
</span><span class="boring">type Fn3 = fn(&amp;i32, &amp;mut i32);
</span><span class="boring">type Fn4 = fn(&amp;i32, &amp;mut i32);
</span><span class="boring">type Fn5 = fn(&amp;i32, &amp;i32, &amp;i32);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>let fn1: Fn1 = |a, b, c, d| { *a = 1; *b = 2; *c = 0; *d = 0; };
let fn2: Fn2 = |a,    c   | *c += *a;
let fn3: Fn3 = |   b, c   | *c += *b;
let fn4: Fn4 = |      c, d| *d += *c;
let fn5: Fn5 = |a, b, c   | println!("{a} + {b} = {c}");</code></pre>
<p>Even though it is possible to order these sequentially, we also want to be able to achieve concurrency to increase performance.</p>

<p>For correctness, <code>fn1</code> must be executed before both <code>fn2</code> and <code>fn3</code>, and those must complete before <code>fn4</code> and <code>fn5</code> are executed.</p>
<h2 id="data-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#data-dependencies">Data Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Note that <code>fn4</code> and <code>fn5</code> can both be executed in parallel, as there is no overlap in accessed data.</p>
<p>However, <code>fn2</code> and <code>fn3</code> both require mutable access to <code>C</code>. Since it is not possible to safely provide both <code>fn2</code> and <code>fn3</code> with mutable access, <code>fn_graph</code> automatically introduces a data dependency between those functions to ensure consistent ordering:</p>

<p>When ordering has been defined, consumers can use <a href="https://docs.rs/fn_graph/latest/fn_graph/struct.FnGraph.html#method.iter"><code>FnGraph::iter</code></a> to iterate through the graph and invoke each function sequentially. When the <code>"async"</code> feature is enabled, which is on by default, <a href="https://docs.rs/fn_graph/latest/fn_graph/struct.FnGraph.html#method.stream"><code>FnGraph::stream</code></a> will produce each function once all of its predecessors have been streamed and returned.</p>
<p>To know when a function is available to be streamed, <a href="https://github.com/azriel91/fn_graph"><code>fn_graph</code></a> uses the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track the number of predecessors of each node.</li>
<li>When streaming, each time a function is streamed and the closure returns, subtract 1 from the predecessor counts of each of that function's successors.</li>
<li>If the predecessor count of a function is 0, it is now available to be streamed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visualized"><a class="header" href="#visualized">Visualized</a></h2>
<ol>

<p>In the example scenario, each function has a number of predecessors:</p>

<p>Notably there is some overhead with the asynchronous execution, but as the number of functions grow, so should the concurrency, and the performance gains should increase proportionally.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="item"><a class="header" href="#item">Item</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> 🚧 means the concept is not yet implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <strong>item</strong> is something that can be created, inspected, and cleaned up by automation.</p>
<p>"Itemification" is to define data types and logic to manage that item.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/peace_cfg/latest/peace_cfg/trait.Item.html"><code>Item</code></a> trait and associated types are how consumers integrate with the Peace framework. Consumers provide a unique ID, data types, and functions, which will be selectively executed by the framework to provide lean, robust automation, and a good user experience.</p>
<p>This logical breakdown guides automation developers to structure logic to handle cases that are not normally considered of when writing automation. Combined with trait requirements on data types, the framework is able to provide commands, workflow optimizations, and understandable output to ensure a pleasant automation experience.</p>
<h2 id="data-types"><a class="header" href="#data-types">Data Types</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Error:</strong> The umbrella error type returned when <em>anything</em> goes wrong when managing the item.</li>
<li><strong>State:</strong> Information about a managed item, can be divided into logical and physical state.</li>
<li><strong>Logical state:</strong> Part of the state that can be controlled, e.g. application server's existence.</li>
<li><strong>Physical state:</strong> Part of the state that cannot be controlled, e.g. application server's instance ID.</li>
<li><strong>Current state:</strong> Current <strong>State</strong> of the managed item, both logical and physical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal state:</strong> <strong>Logical State</strong> that one wants the item to be in.</li>
<li><strong>State difference:</strong> Difference between the current <strong>Logical state</strong> and the <strong>Goal state</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="logic--building-blocks"><a class="header" href="#logic--building-blocks">Logic – Building Blocks</a></h2>
<details>
<summary>1. Define an ID.</summary>
<div>
`Item::id`
<p>Provide the framework with a unique ID for this item.</p>
<p>These are intended to be safe to use as file names, as well as avoid surprises, and so have been limited to alphanumeric characters and underscores, and cannot begin with a number. This is validated at compile time by using the <code>item_id!("..")</code> macro.</p>
<p>The examples in the <code>peace</code> repository will use <code>snake_case</code>, but the rules are flexible enough to accept <code>PascalCase</code> or <code>camelCase</code> if that is preferred.</p>
<h3 id="examples-1"><a class="header" href="#examples-1">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Item that manages a file download: <code>"download"</code>.</li>
<li>Item that manages a server: <code>"server_existence"</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>2. Initialize framework with parameters to manage item.</summary>
<div>
`Item::setup`
<p><em>🚧 parameters are passed in for each command</em></p>
<!-- We should take in a serializable type for initialization. Serializable because it will allow the item to be initialized on a separate host. -->
<p>Provide the framework with enough information to begin managing the item.</p>
<p>This function also instantiates the data types referenced by this <code>Item</code> into the <code>Resources</code> map.</p>
<h3 id="examples-2"><a class="header" href="#examples-2">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a file download:</p>
<p>Required parameters are the URL to download from, and the destination file path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a server:</p>
<p>Required parameters are the base image ID to launch the server with, and hardware specs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>3. Fetch current item state.</summary>
<div>
`Item::state_current`
<p>This may not necessarily be a cheap function, for example if it needs to make web requests that take seconds to complete.</p>
<h3 id="examples-3"><a class="header" href="#examples-3">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a file download:</p>
<p>Current state is checking a file's existence and contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a server:</p>
<p>Current state is checking a server's existence and its base image ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>4. Fetch goal item state.</summary>
<div>
`Item::StateGoalFn`
<p>This may not necessarily be a cheap function, for example if it needs to make web requests that take seconds to complete.</p>
<h3 id="examples-4"><a class="header" href="#examples-4">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a file download:</p>
<p>Goal state is file metadata retrieved from a remote server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a server:</p>
<p>Goal state is one server exists with the specified the base image ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>5. Return the difference between current and goal states.</summary>
<div>
`Item::StateDiffFn`
<p>It is important that both the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are shown for values that have changed, and values that have not changed or are not relevant, are not returned.</p>
<h3 id="examples-5"><a class="header" href="#examples-5">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a file download:</p>
<p>State difference is a change from a file that does not exist, to a file with contents <code>"abc"</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Item that manages a server:</p>
<p>State difference is a change from a non-existent server, to a server exists with the specified the base image ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>6. Ensure that the item is in the goal state.</summary>
<div>
Transforms the current state to the goal state.
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>check</code>: Returns whether <code>exec</code> needs to be run to transform the current state into the goal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>exec</code>: Actual logic to transform the current state to the goal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>exec_dry</code>: Dry-run transform of the current state to the goal state.</p>
<p>Like <code>exec</code>, but all interactions with external services, or writes to the file system should be substituted with mocks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>7. Clean up the item.</summary>
<div>
Cleans up the item from existence.
<ol>
<li><code>check</code>: Returns whether <code>exec</code> needs to be run to clean up the item.</li>
<li><code>exec</code>: Actual logic to clean up the item.</li>
<li><code>exec_dry</code>: Dry-run clean up of the item.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</details>
## Comparison with `git`

<tr><td style="text-align: left">State</td><td style="text-align: left">Consumer defined information about the item.</td><td style="text-align: left">Current state is the latest commit, goal state is the working directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">State retrieval</td><td style="text-align: left">On request by user using the <code>StatesDiscover</code> command.</td><td style="text-align: left">Retrieved each time the <code>status</code> command is run, cheap since it is all local.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">State display</td><td style="text-align: left">On request using <code>state</code> and <code>goal</code> commands</td><td style="text-align: left"><code>show $revision:path</code> command shows the state at a particular <code>$revision</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">State difference</td><td style="text-align: left">On request using <code>diff</code> command</td><td style="text-align: left"><code>status</code> command shows a summary, <code>show</code> and <code>diff</code> commands shows the state difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">State application</td><td style="text-align: left">On request through the <code>ensure</code> command.</td><td style="text-align: left">On request through <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> commands.</td></tr>

<p>There are a number of related concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User needs to be able to specify how the <em>values</em> are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plain Values:</strong> Use a value provided by the user.</li>
<li><strong>Referenced Values:</strong> Use a value produced by a predecessor item.</li>
<li><strong>Transformed Values:</strong> Take values produced by predecessor item(s), transform it, then use that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to define the parameters.</li>
<li>Take in parameter values for <code>state_current</code>, <code>state_goal</code>.</li>
<li>Take in <code>Option&lt;Field&gt;</code> for each field within the parameter for <code>try_state_current</code>, <code>try_state_goal</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace should be able to store and load:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specification by the user.</li>
<li>The actual values computed and used during command execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="value-specification"><a class="header" href="#value-specification">Value Specification</a></h1>
<p>Item parameter values are eventually concrete values.</p>
<p>Some of those concrete values are not necessarily known until partway through a flow execution. When a flow is defined, a user needs a way to encode where a value comes from.</p>

<p>A variation of plain values is to provide a lookup function that is evaluated at the point the value is needed, but that has potential negative effects for user experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Web service call(s) may take seconds to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Multiple executions may discover different values between different command executions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In code, this may look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let app_params_spec = AppParams::spec()
    .repo_path(Path::from("/path/to/project"))
    .build();
let server_params_spec = ServerParams::spec()
    .image_id(image_id!("abcd1234"))
    .instance_size(InstanceSize::Large)
    .build();

cmd_ctx_builder
    .with_item_params(app_params_spec)
    .with_item_params(server_params_spec)
    .await?;</code></pre>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="params-specification"><a class="header" href="#params-specification">Params Specification</a></h1>
<p>For an item to work with different values, the values must be passed in.</p>
<p>Item implementors define these as part of the <code>Item</code> trait:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">trait Item {
    type Params: ..;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use Cases</a></h2>
<p>The following shows a number of use cases of these params:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>State Apply:</strong> Param values must be known, and Peace should pass concrete values to the <code>Item::{state_current, state_goal, apply}</code> functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State Discovery (fallible):</strong></p>
<p>Param values may be known, if predecessors have previously executed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>try_state_current</code>: <code>StateDiscoverCmd::current</code></p>
<p>e.g. Look up file contents on a remote host:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">match params_partial.dest_ip() {
    Some(dest_ip) =&gt; Some(file_hash(dest_ip, path)),
    None =&gt; None, // or `Some(FileState::None)`
}</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>try_state_goal</code>: <code>StateDiscoverCmd::goal</code></p>
<p>e.g. Look up source file contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">match params_partial.src_path() {
    Some(src_path) =&gt; file_hash(src_path),
    None =&gt; None, // or `Some(FileState::None)`
}</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="by-item-function"><a class="header" href="#by-item-function">By Item Function</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>try_state_current</code>: Should work with <code>field_partial</code>s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>try_state_goal</code>: Should work with <code>field_partial</code>s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state_current</code>: Needs real concrete param values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state_goal</code>: Needs real concrete param values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state_diff</code>: Doesn't need parameters or data; everything should be captured in <code>State</code>s.</p>
<p>But for presentation, it's useful to know what a file should be (current vs goal), or difference between params (multiple profile current vs current).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state_clean</code>: Maybe always returns <code>ItemState::None</code>, and doesn't need parameters or data.</p>
<p>However, presenting <code>state_clean</code> with e.g. a file path, would mean the None state contains the value, which means <code>state_clean</code> needs params.</p>
<p>Arguably <code>state_goal</code> will show the path that would be created.</p>
<p><code>StateDiff</code> for cleaning should also show the deletion of the path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>apply_check</code>: Doesn't need parameters or data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>apply_dry</code>: Needs concrete param values, even if they are fake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>apply</code>: Needs real concrete param values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encoding-serialization--deserialization"><a class="header" href="#encoding-serialization--deserialization">Encoding: Serialization / Deserialization</a></h3>
<p>Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is convenient to serialize <code>Item::Params::Spec</code> and store it, and deserialize it for use at a later time.</li>
<li>It is useful to support config-based parameter specification (no compiler needed).</li>
<li>It is not possible to serialize closures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there must be a way to encode the same functionality that <code>Item::Params::Spec::field_from_map</code> provides, as something serializable.</p>
<p>Possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ToString</code> and <code>FromStr</code> impls that represent the logic</li>
<li>Serialized form uses enum variants, and when deserializing, map that back to functions.</li>
<li>Custom language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-implications"><a class="header" href="#code-implications">Code Implications</a></h2>
<p>From the implementor's perspective, item trait needs to change to support the above use cases.</p>
<p>The following snippets are here to show the changes that include the above concepts. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-compilable.</li>
<li>just enough to show where types are changed.</li>
<li>show certain trait bounds (non-exhaustive).</li>
<li>do not include the encoding / decoding of <code>field_from_map</code> concept.</li>

<h4 id="design-note"><a class="header" href="#design-note">Design Note</a></h4>
<p>The <code>apply_check</code> and <code>state_diff</code> functions <em>usually</em> are not expected to need <code>params</code> and <code>data</code>, but some items may use them, such as the <code>ShCmdItem</code> which accesses params to determine the script to run.</p>
<p>Regarding params will be <code>Params</code> or <code>Params&lt;'_&gt;::Partial</code> for <code>state_diff</code>, if we call <code>state_diff</code> for a file upload item, we must have both the current state and goal state. Then we need to ask, does having both states imply <code>Params</code> is fully resolvable?</p>
<p>If we call <code>state_current</code> for a file upload:</p>
<ul>
<li>the destination server may not be there</li>

<p>For ergonomic usage and accurate data modelling, the following types need to exist for each item:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Params</code></li>
<li><code>ParamsPartial</code></li>
<li><code>ParamsSpec</code></li>
<li><code>ParamsSpecBuilder</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Since <code>Params</code> is defined by the item implementor, the other three structs can only be defined after it, and can be generated by a proc macro.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How does Peace know what fields to fill in, and how?</p>
<p>The fields are known by the <code>ParamsSpec</code> impl, though it resides in the implementor's crate.</p>
<p>Peace can reference the <code>ParamsSpec</code> through a <code>Params::Spec</code> associated type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Peace need to know about the field, or can it be in the generated impl?</p>
<p>It needs to go, for each field on the <code>ParamsSpec</code>, fill in the <code>ParamsPartial</code>. This could be implemented by <code>ParamsSpec::partial_from(&amp;Resources) -&gt; ParamsPartial</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">impl ParamsSpec {
    fn partial_from(resources: &amp;Resources) -&gt; ParamsPartial {
        // for each field (generated by proc macro)
        let value_0 = value_0_spec.try_value_from(resources);
        let value_1 = value_1_spec.try_value_from(resources);

        ParamsPartial { value_0, value_1 }
    }
}

enum ValueSpec&lt;T&gt; {
    Value(T),
    From,
    FromMap(Box&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Resources) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;),
}

impl&lt;T&gt; ValueSpec&lt;T&gt; {
    fn try_value_from(&amp;self, resources: &amp;Resources) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
        match self {
            Self::Value(t) =&gt; Some(t.clone()),
            Self::From =&gt; resources.try_borrow::&lt;T&gt;().cloned(),
            Self::FromMap(f) =&gt; f(resources),
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does <code>ValueSpec::FromMap</code> get instantiated:</p>
<p>Probably something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">impl ParamsSpecBuilder {
    // for each field
    fn field_from_map&lt;F, U&gt;(mut self, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where F: &amp;U -&gt; Field {
        let from_map_boxed = Box::new(move |resources| {
            resources.try_borrow::&lt;Field&gt;().map(f)
        });
        self.field_spec = ValueSpec::FromMap(from_map_boxed);
        self
    }
}</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow Peace to reference those types, and for Peace to expose that to users, we need the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dyn Params</code>: To know what type the <code>ParamsPartial</code>, <code>ParamsSpec</code>, and <code>ParamsSpecBuilder</code> are.</li>
<li><code>dyn ParamsSpec</code>: Peace needs the spec to generate a <code>ParamsPartial</code> from <code>Resources</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implications-on-serialization-and-flow-params"><a class="header" href="#implications-on-serialization-and-flow-params">Implications On Serialization and Flow Params</a></h2>
<p>It is inconvenient to have to register item params types as flow params, because the presence of the item could automatically tell Peace its params type.</p>
<p>However, users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must provide the param values / spec for each item for the first execution of a flow.</li>
<li>May have different preferences whether they have to provide the values / spec for subsequent executions, and whether it implicitly uses what was used before, or is explicit for each field.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow params are serialized separately. Flow params may be values that control how things are presented, but not affect the actual functional execution, so they may be log verbosity.</li>
<li>Item params spec must be deserialized, and overwritten by provided values.</li>
<li>Item params spec must be serialized before executing a command.</li>
<li>Item params must be serialized as execution happens.</li>
<li>Item params partials do not need to be serialized, only presented, as they can be re-calculated from state for each discover / read command execution.</li>
</ul>

## Dry Run
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let resources = Item::apply_dry(graph, resources).await?;</code></pre>
<p>Similar to the <code>Item::apply</code>, <code>Item::apply_dry</code> is meant to simulate what <em>would</em> happen, and allow users to correct mistakes before actual execution.</p>
<p>Implementers must replace all <em>write</em> logic with mocks. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>File writes</li>
<li>Web requests</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also recommended that <em>read</em> requests to external services are minimized to decrease the time to return feedback to the user. If possible, move read request logic to <code>Item::state_current</code> so that it is stored by the <code>StatesDiscoverCmd</code>.</p>
<h2 id="convergence--non-transactional-execution-recovery"><a class="header" href="#convergence--non-transactional-execution-recovery">Convergence / Non-Transactional Execution Recovery</a></h2>
<p>Since these processes happen over distributed systems, and errors can happen at any point in the process, it is realistic to assume that the process doesn't happen transactionally.</p>
<p><code>ApplyFns</code> has been designed so that implementers will consider transitions from non-atomic states to the goal state. In simpler terms, if the goal state is "10 servers must exist", then:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the current state is 0 servers, then 10 servers should be launched.</li>
<li>When the current state is 6 servers, then 4 servers should be launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>As time and effort is saved by reusing existing useful state and not requiring complete clean up, recoverability and user experience is improved.</p>
<!-- Executing a subset of the graph. Cleaning a subset, and re-ensuring from that point. -->

<h2 id="partial-clean"><a class="header" href="#partial-clean">Partial Clean</a></h2>
<p>Even though it is possible to clean up the server without uninstalling the application, it is recommended that the <code>CleanOpSpec</code> is implemented for every item.</p>
<!-- Value -->
<p>Imagine one has a goal to test fresh installations of different versions of an application. One approach is to deploy each version in a separate environment, and clean up the whole environment, . have a command that only uninstalls the application from the server, .</p>
<p>Least-work approach, but needs additional engineering.</p>
<!-- reverts the state of the system to a particular point in the graph -->
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="state"><a class="header" href="#state">State</a></h1>
<p>In <code>peace</code>, <a href="https://docs.rs/peace_cfg/latest/peace_cfg/state/struct.State.html"><code>State</code></a> represents the values of an item, and has the following usages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing users the state of an item.</li>
<li>Allowing users to describe the state that an item should be.</li>
<li>Determining what needs to change between the current state and the goal state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <code>State</code> should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serializable</li>
<li>Displayable in a human readable format</li>
<li>Relatively lightweight – e.g. does not necessarily contain file contents, but a hash of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="logical-and-physical-state"><a class="header" href="#logical-and-physical-state">Logical and Physical State</a></h2>
<p>State can be separated into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical state:</strong> Information that is functionally important, and can be specified by the user ahead of time.</p>
<p>Examples of logical state are:</p>
<ul>
<li>File contents</li>
<li>An application version</li>
<li>Server operating system version</li>
<li>Server CPU capacity</li>
<li>Server RAM capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical state:</strong> Information that is discovered / produced when the automation is executed.</p>
<p>Examples of physical state are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ETag of a downloaded file.</li>
<li>Execution time of a command.</li>
<li>Server ID that is generated on launch.</li>
<li>Server IP address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defining-state"><a class="header" href="#defining-state">Defining State</a></h2>
<h3 id="fully-logical"><a class="header" href="#fully-logical">Fully Logical</a></h3>
<p>If an item's state can be fully described before the item exists, and can be made to happen without interacting with an external service, then the state is fully logical.</p>
<p>For example, copying a file from one directory to another. The state of the file in the source directory and destination directories are fully discoverable, and there is no information generated during automation that is needed to determine if the states are equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="logical-and-physical"><a class="header" href="#logical-and-physical">Logical and Physical</a></h3>
<p>If an item's goal state can be described before the item exists, but interacts with an external service which produces additional information to bring that goal state into existence, then the state has both logical and physical parts.</p>
<p>For example, launching a server or virtual machine. The operating system, CPU capacity, and RAM are logical information, and can be determined ahead of time. However, the server ID and IP address are produced by the virtual machine service provider, which is physical state.</p>
<h3 id="fully-physical"><a class="header" href="#fully-physical">Fully Physical</a></h3>
<p>If an item's goal state is simply, "automation has been executed after these files have been modified", then the state has no logical component.</p>
<p>For example, running a compilation command only if the compilation artifact doesn't exist, or the source files have changed since the last time the compilation has been executed.</p>
<hr />
<p>The remaining pages in this section explain how to define the logical and physical state types when implementing an item.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="logical-state"><a class="header" href="#logical-state">Logical State</a></h1>
<p>Logical state is the part of an item that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementor / user definable</li>
<li>Controllable by automation</li>
<li>Deterministic</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uses"><a class="header" href="#uses">Uses</a></h2>
<p>There are three uses of logical state:</p>
<ol>
<li>Representing current state.</li>
<li>Representing goal state.</li>
<li>Computing state difference.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let params = data.params();

// `dest` references the actual item that is being managed.
// e.g. calculate content hash of actual file being written to.
let state_current = params.dest().read();

// `src` references the *specification* of what the item is intended to be.
// e.g. retrieve content hash from a source file.
let state_goal = params.src().read();

// We can only compute the `diff` when both `src` and `dest` are available.
let state_diff = state_goal - state_current;</code></pre>
<h2 id="discovery-constraints"><a class="header" href="#discovery-constraints">Discovery Constraints</a></h2>
<p>In an item's parameters, there must be the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>src</code>: information of what the item should be, or where to look up that information.</p>
<p>Thus, <code>src</code> is a reference to where to look up <code>state_goal</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dest</code>: reference to where the actual item should be.</p>
<p><code>dest</code> is a reference to where to push <code>state_current</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <code>src</code> and <code>dest</code> may reference resources that are ensured by predecessor items. Meaning sometimes <code>state_goal</code> and <code>state_current</code> cannot be discovered because they rely on the predecessors' completions.</p>
<h3 id="examples-6"><a class="header" href="#examples-6">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A list of files in a zip file cannot be read, if the zip file is not downloaded.</li>
<li>A file on a server cannot be read, if the server doesn't exist.</li>
<li>A server cannot have a domain name assigned to it, if the server doesn't exist.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implications"><a class="header" href="#implications">Implications</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <code>dest</code> is not available, then <code>state_current</code> may simply be "does not exist".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>src</code> is not available, and we want to show <code>state_goal</code> that is not just "we can't look it up", then <code>src</code> must be defined in terms of something readable during discovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that is not possible, or is too expensive, then one or more of the following has to be chosen:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>Item::state_goal</code> functions have to always cater for <code>src</code> not being available.</p>
<p>It incurs mental effort to always cater for <code>src</code> not being available – i.e. implementing an item would need knowledge beyond itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <code>peace</code> framework defaults to not running <code>state_current_fn</code> for items that have a logical dependency on things that <code>Item::apply_check</code> returns <code>ExecRequired</code></p>
<p>For this to work, when the current state is requested, <code>peace</code> will:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each non-parent item, run <code>state_current</code>, <code>state_goal</code>, <code>state_diff</code>, and <code>apply_check</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>apply_check</code> returns <code>ApplyCheck::ExecNotRequired</code>, then successor items can be processed as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>state_current</code> could return <code>Result&lt;Option&lt;Status&gt;, E&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Ok(None)</code>: State cannot be discovered, likely because predecessor hasn't run</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Ok(Some(State&lt;_, _&gt;))</code>: State cannot be discovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Err(E)</code>: An error happened when discovering state.</p>
<p>May be difficult to distinguish some cases from <code>Ok(None)</code>, e.g. failed to connect to server, is it because the server doesn't exist, or because the address is incorrect.</p>
<p>Should we have two <code>state_current</code>s? Or pass in whether it's being called from <code>Discover</code> vs <code>Ensure</code> – i.e. some information that says "err when failing to connect because the predecessor has been ensured".</p>
</li>
</ul>
 <!--  -->
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 2 may be something we have to do anyway – we will not be able to provide current state to run <code>Item::apply</code> for successors for the same reason.</p>
<p>Option 3 may coexist with option 2.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> State discovery may be expensive, so it is important to be able to show a stored copy of what is discovered.</p>

From the above table, further thoughts include:
<ul>
<li>Information that changes at a high rate implies a high rate of requests.</li>
<li>Information requested at a high rate may need to be small (in size).</li>
<li>Progress output is frequent, and is most important in real time / as it happens.</li>
<li>If frequency is high and the output is transferred between hosts, then ideally the size of the output is reduced.</li>
<li>The point of serialized data without the friendliness requirement is space and time efficiency.</li>
<li>Friendly serialized data may be a format such as YAML / JSON / TOML.</li>
<li>Pulled data is either over an API, or viewing historical information, meaning pulled data needs to be serializable.</li>
<li>Web page output may be large, but mental overload can be avoided by hiding information through interactivity.</li>

<p>Execution progress output is most useful as it happens. Execution progress output should fulfill the following concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy for a human to understand</li>
<li>easy to be sent from an item implementation</li>
<li>pushed to output in real time</li>
<li>pulled from client in real time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information"><a class="header" href="#information">Information</a></h2>
<p>Information that is likely useful to the consumer, and therefore should be captured, and sent if bandwidth is not an issue.</p>
<h3 id="progress-status"><a class="header" href="#progress-status">Progress Status</a></h3>
<p>Whether a task has started, is in-progress, stalled, or completed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution Pending:</strong> Execution is pending a predecessor's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Running:</strong> Execution is in progress.</p>
<p>This status is best conveyed alongside the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Units total:</strong> Unknown (spinner) / known (progress bar).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Units current</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> <code>Item::{state_current, state_goal, apply}</code>.</p>
<p>Certain functions will not be applicable, e.g. when <code>StateCurrent</code> is feature gated, then the function won't be available when the feature is not enabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Running Stalled:</strong> Progress updates have not been received for a given period.</p>
<p>Item implementations are responsible for sending progress updates, but if there are no progress updates, or an identical "it's running" progress update is continuously received, then Peace may determine that the task may have stalled, and user attention is required.</p>
<p>Peace may also provide a hook for implementors to output a suggestion to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Pending:</strong> Task is pending user input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Completed:</strong> Task has completed.</p>
<p>This status is best conveyed alongside the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completion Status</strong>: Success, Failed.</li>
<li><strong>Function:</strong> <code>Item::{state_current, state_goal, apply}</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following variant is possible conceptually, but not applicable to the Peace framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stopped:</strong> Task is not running, but can be started.</p>
<p>This is not applicable because Peace uses runtime borrowing to manage state, and a stopped task has potentially altered data non-atomically, so locking the data is not useful, and unlocking the data may cause undefined behaviour due to reasoning over inconsistent state.</p>
<p>For rate limiting tasks, the task in its entirety would be held back.</p>

<li>REST endpoint (pull)</li>

</ul>
<p><sup>1</sup> even if it is not yet implemented, it should be designed in a way that allows for it</p>
<h2 id="api"><a class="header" href="#api">API</a></h2>
<p>Implementors define the following in <code>ApplyFns::check</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit of measurement: Steps, Bytes, Percentage, None</li>
<li>Units total: Known / Unknown</li>
<li>Units initially completed: Numeric / Unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>Units remaining is tracked by Peace as the unit of progress is ticked (updated).</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implementors manually ticking progress</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More accurate information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code becomes messy -- progress ticks scattered throughout code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/athre0z/zzz"><code>zzz</code></a> has a really good way of doing this without making things messy:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>(0..1000).into_iter().progress()
//                    ^^^^^^^^^^
// This is all that's needed to render the progress bar
// assuming `size_hint()` is implemented.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Peace could provide something like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl ApplyFns for MyApplyFns {
    async fn exec(data: Data&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;(), E&gt; {
        [
            Self::fn_1,
            Self::fn_2,
            Self::fn_3,
            Self::fn_4,
        ].progress(data);
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But that constrains the signature of each sub function to be the same. A type parameterized function chain – where the return value of one function is the parameter to the next – may be messy, especially for error messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For spinners, manually ticking the progress bar can be cumbersome, but automatic ticking will give a false impression of progress happening. Somewhat mitigated by stall detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codegen to add progress ticks</p>
<p>This could be done with a proc macro that counts the number of expressions, with some clever handling of conditionals, and inserts <code>tick()</code> expressions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For now Peace will require implementors to manual tick the progress, and in the future, explore the following option:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trait to automatically tick progress for iterators.</li>
<li>Proc macro to automatically insert ticks.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="presentation"><a class="header" href="#presentation">Presentation</a></h1>
<p>For human readable output, it is desirable for consumers as well as the framework to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output arbitrary types.</li>
<li>Have them formatted by the output implementation.</li>
<li>Not require the output implementation to know the specific type that is being output.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>OutputWrite</code> trait was written to handle different output formats – human-readable vs CI logging vs structured text – but not how to <em>present</em> the output.</p>
<p>Peace should provide two traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>OutputWrite</code>: Maps between the information and the output format, e.g. human readable vs parseable.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CLI output:</strong> Writes progress as log messages (CI), or progress bar (interactive), or nothing (when piped).</li>
<li><strong>Web output:</strong> Write JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Native application:</strong> Update a UI component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Presentable</code>: Maps between the information and the presentation format, e.g. present this as an ID, short text, long text, a list, etcetera.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CLI output:</strong> Colour text with ANSI colour codes.</li>
<li><strong>Web output:</strong> Create and style web elements.</li>
<li><strong>Native application:</strong> Create and style UI components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="current-state"><a class="header" href="#current-state">Current State</a></h2>
<p>The <code>OutputWrite</code> trait has methods for:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing progress: setting up state, updating progress, and ending.</li>
<li>writing states (current, goal, diff, etc.)</li>
<li>writing error</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods are specific to <code>State</code>s, and if we add methods per type, it doesn't allow any arbitrary type to be formatted and written.</p>
<h2 id="goal-state"><a class="header" href="#goal-state">Goal State</a></h2>
<p>To be usable with arbitrary information, <code>OutputWrite</code> should have methods to output different <em>kinds</em> of information. These information <em>kinds</em> are based on the purpose of the information, not on how they should be grouped or presented.</p>
<h3 id="information-kinds"><a class="header" href="#information-kinds">Information Kinds</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Progress:</strong> Information about the execution of automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Information that the automation is purposed to produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Meta information about the outcome or progress -- informatives, warnings.</p>
<p>These can be used to refine the automation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For each information kind, <code>OutputWrite</code> should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write one or many of that information kind</li>
<li>Reason over the parameters of that information, and potentially pass it to a formatter.</li>
</ul>
<p>For structured output, all information should be serializable.</p>
<h3 id="presentation--formatting"><a class="header" href="#presentation--formatting">Presentation / Formatting</a></h3>
<p>For human readable output to be <em>understandable</em>, the <code>OutputWrite</code> implementation should improve clarity by adding styling or reducing information overload. For this to work with arbitrary types, the <code>OutputWrite</code> needs additional hints to determine how to format the information.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>An object may be presented as a list, and the type needs to define which fields that list is built from.</li>
<li>When presenting a list of named items, the type needs to define both the name and the description, which allows the names to be styled differently to the descriptions.</li>
<li>When presenting a large object, the density of information can be reduced through collapsible sections, and more detail displayed when the sections are expanded.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="implementation-1"><a class="header" href="#implementation-1">Implementation</a></h4>
<p>To achieve this, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define a <code>peace::fmt::Presentable</code> trait, analogous to <code>std::fmt::Display</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define a <code>peace::fmt::Presenter</code> trait, analogous to <code>std::fmt::Formatter</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Presenter</code> has methods to format:</p>
<ul>
<li>short text descriptions</li>
<li>long text descriptions (e.g. always split at <code>\n</code>s)</li>
<li>names, e.g. always bold</li>
<li>lists of <code>Presentable</code>s</li>
<li>groups, e.g. always collapsible, or presenter may choose to not display if level of detail is too high</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementors will <code>impl Presentable for MyType</code>. This can be made easier with a derive macro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update <code>OutputWrite</code> to take in <code>&amp;dyn Presentable</code> instead of concrete types, and the <code>OutputWrite</code> implementation can decide whether or not to delegate to <code>Presenter</code> for presentation information. e.g. a serializing output write may not need to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Structured output that is read by humans (e.g. prettified YAML or JSON) is not a <code>peace::fmt::Presentable</code> concern, but an <code>OutputWrite</code> parameter, as it is a standard format serialization parameter, not formatting hints that the output endpoint needs.</p>
<p>Instead of using <code>&amp;str</code>s for what is presented, we could add type safety to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforce certain constraints, e.g. short descriptions must be one line, less than 200 characters</li>
<li>For human readable output, instead of <code>std::fmt::Display</code>, types implement <code>peace::fmt::Presentable</code> trait where a <code>peace::fmt::Presenter</code> is passed in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The type safety can be opt-in, e.g. allow <code>&amp;str</code>s, but if using the type-safe wrappers, you get compilation errors when the constraints are not met.</p>
<h4 id="recursion"><a class="header" href="#recursion">Recursion</a></h4>
<p>If the <code>Presentable</code> trait is recursive like <code>Debug</code>, then we need to make sure implementors understand that a "name" will always be styled as a name, unless one creates a wrapping type that does not delegate to the name's underlying <code>Presentable</code> implementation (just like <code>Debug</code>).</p>

<p>An outcome diagram should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show the "physical" items that exist / yet-to-exist / to-be-cleaned.</li>
<li>Show which steps are linked to it, e.g. clicking on a file shows the steps that write to / read from the file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="determining-information-for-rendering"><a class="header" href="#determining-information-for-rendering">Determining Information for Rendering</a></h2>
<p>To render the outcome diagram, we need to deduce the physical things from <code>Item</code>s, and determine:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> where data comes from, whether completely from parameters, or whether parameters are a reference to the data.</li>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> where data moves to or the system work is done to.</li>
<li>Whether the source or destination are declared in parameters.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of 2024-02-18, <code>Item::Params</code> is a single type, which would take in both <strong>source</strong> and <strong>destination</strong> parameters, so we cannot (realistically) determine the source/destination/host/cloud from the <code>Item::Params</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="what-rendering-makes-sense"><a class="header" href="#what-rendering-makes-sense">What Rendering Makes Sense</a></h2>
<p>Conceptually, <code>Item</code>s can be thought of either an edge or a node:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge:</strong> The item represents an action / work to between the source(s) and the destination(s).</li>
<li><strong>Node:</strong> The item represents the destination thing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naive"><a class="header" href="#naive">Naive</a></h3>
<p>Consider the following diagram, which is the first attempt at rendering an outcome diagram on 2024-02-18 -- this uses edges / hierarchy to draw nodes and edges:</p>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="outcome/2024-02-18_outcome_diagram.svg" />
</object>
<h4 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>It is not clear where the <code>app_download</code> <code>Item</code> transfers the file from, or to.</li>
<li>It is not clear that the <code>iam_policy</code>, <code>iam_role</code>, and <code>instance_profile</code> are defined in AWS.</li>
<li>The links between <code>iam_policy</code>, <code>iam_role</code>, and <code>instance_profile</code> should probably be reversed, to indicate what references what.</li>
<li>The <code>s3_object</code> item transfers the downloaded application file, to the S3 bucket created by <code>s3_bucket</code>, but it isn't clear whether we should be highlighting the link, or the nested node.</li>
<li>If we highlight the link, then note that it is a forward link (data is pushed), compared to point 3 which are backward links (references).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hosts-realms-and-edges"><a class="header" href="#hosts-realms-and-edges">Hosts, Realms, and Edges</a></h3>
<p>If we could show:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hosts of all network communication</li>
<li>The "realm" where resources live in, which may be a cloud provider or a region within</li>
<li>A node for each resource that is created/modified/deleted</li>
<li>For each item, the edges and nodes that interact</li>
</ol>
<p>then what is happening becomes slightly clearer:</p>

<li>There is only one level of detail.</li>
<li>It is useful to have expandable detail, e.g. hide a full URL, and allow the user to expand it if they need to.</li>
<li>It is useful to show and hide animated edges while that step is in progress.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="render-technology"><a class="header" href="#render-technology">Render Technology</a></h1>
<p>Currently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graphviz <code>dot</code> is used to render the SVG.</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS is used to define and generate styles.</li>
<li><code>leptos</code> is used with <code>axum</code> to serve the graph in a web application.</li>
<li><code>dot_ix</code> connects those together.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other use cases and desirable features that are difficult to implement with the current technology, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rendering the outcome on a command line interface.</li>
<li>Richer formatting, also by item implementors.</li>
<li>Controllable / predictable / consistent node positioning.</li>
<li>Serializing the outcome rendering, for later display.</li>
<li>Diffing two outcome diagrams.</li>
<li>Rendering errors and recovery hints.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="command-line-interface"><a class="header" href="#command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</a></h2>
<p>Rendering the outcome on the CLI is not really necessary when the user is able to use a web browser to see the outcome. If the user is connected to a server via SSH, the tool could technically serve the web interface locally, and an SSH tunnel used to forward the traffic.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus"><code>dioxus</code></a> may allow us to have single source for both the web and CLI, but this is not known for sure -- <a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/plasmo"><code>plasmo</code></a>, the crate that takes HTML and renders it on the terminal does not handle <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements on the terminal, so exploration is needed to determine if this is suitable.</p>
<h2 id="rich-formatting"><a class="header" href="#rich-formatting">Rich Formatting</a></h2>
<p>For richer formatting, the <code>Presentable</code> trait was intended to capture this. However, serialization of different types makes the code complex -- I haven't figured out a way to transfer arbitrary types across the server to a client.</p>
<p>One option is to use markdown, and transfer the plain markdown to the target output, which can render it in its own means, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/trishume/syntect"><code>syntect</code></a> for CLI, and <a href="https://hrzn.ee/kivikakk/comrak"><code>comrak</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/pulldown-cmark/pulldown-cmark"><code>pulldown-cmark</code></a> (what <code>mdbook</code> uses) to generate HTML for the web.</p>
<p>We would have to automatically nest markdown by indenting inner types' markdown.</p>
<h2 id="controllable-node-positioning"><a class="header" href="#controllable-node-positioning">Controllable Node Positioning</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nadavrot/layout"><code>layout</code></a> is a Rust port of a subset of <code>dot</code>. Essentially there are no HTML-like labels, but it is written in Rust. It likely has consistent node positioning, so using it over <code>dot</code> has that advantage, with the added benefits of performance and portability. <a href="https://www.vizdom.dev/"><code>vizdom</code></a> uses it to generate graphs in real time.</p>
<p>Instead of using a <code>dot</code>-like library, generating elements with a flexbox layout, and drawing arrows may be the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="serializing-outcome-rendering"><a class="header" href="#serializing-outcome-rendering">Serializing Outcome Rendering</a></h2>
<p>As long as we have a serializable form, which is <em>stable</em>, we can re-render the diagram later.</p>
<p>This means all information about the flow, parameters, and errors need to be serializable.</p>
<h2 id="diffing-outcome-diagrams"><a class="header" href="#diffing-outcome-diagrams">Diffing Outcome Diagrams</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vizdom.dev/"><code>vizdom</code></a> does this really nicely with <code>dot</code> graphs, see its examples.</p>
<p>Should we do a visual diff? Or clever node matching, then a styling diff?</p>
<h2 id="rendering-errors-and-recovery-hints"><a class="header" href="#rendering-errors-and-recovery-hints">Rendering Errors and Recovery Hints</a></h2>
<p>For rendering errors, we need to know whether the error is to do with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a host / a function run by a host that failed</li>
<li>a connection between hosts</li>
</ul>
<p>then styling it.</p>
<p>For recovery hints, we need to make it clear where the error shown on the the outcome diagram is related to input parameters, whether it is a file, or a value produced by a host.</p>
<p>If we are using <code>dot</code>-like or a CSS-enabled technology, then we can style the relevant edge / node with Tailwind CSS styles.</p>
<h2 id="tailwind-css-generation"><a class="header" href="#tailwind-css-generation">Tailwind CSS generation</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/encre-css"><code>encre-css</code></a> is likely what we will use, as it is TailwindCSS compatible.</p>

It is possible to produce a diagram in a similar style to dot using HTML elements and JS to draw an SVG arrow. The above uses [`leader-line`], which has been archived by the original author.
<p>It doesn't support adding an ID or CSS classes, so either we use its many configuration options, or we find another library which supports rendering arrows and setting classes.</p>

<p>A tool built using the Peace framework must execute in a <em>workspace</em> – a location that Peace reads and writes information when commands are executed.</p>
<p>In a native automation tool, the workspace is usually the repository in which the automation is run, so the <a href="https://docs.rs/peace_resources/latest/peace_resources/paths/struct.WorkspaceDir.html">workspace directory</a> is the repository root. In a WASM tool, Peace currently is able to store information in the browser <code>LocalStorage</code> or <code>SessionStorage</code>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="commands"><a class="header" href="#commands">Commands</a></h1>
<p>Commands in Peace are categorized based on how they interact with a <em>workspace</em>. Make sure you understand the <a href="technical_concepts/workspace.html">Peace workspace model</a>.</p>
<p>The information available within a command execution is called the <strong>command context</strong>. Depending on the scope of a command, the available information changes. Peace's command API adaptively exposes methods that are relevant to the chosen scope.</p>
<p>This section covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scopes:</strong> What information is accessible for each command scope.</li>
<li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Which scope to use and how to create different kinds of commands.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scopes"><a class="header" href="#scopes">Scopes</a></h1>
<p>The scope of a command determines:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it has access to zero, one, or many <code>Profile</code> directories.</li>
<li>If it has access to zero, one, or many <code>Flow</code> directories.</li>
<li>Whether it can deserialize profile params.</li>
<li>Whether it can deserialize flow params.</li>
<li>Whether it can deserialize states from each flow directory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> <code>envman</code> is an example tool that manages server environments.</p>
<p>In the following directory structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>internal_dev_a</code>, <code>customer_a_dev</code>, <code>customer_a_prod</code> are all separate <strong>Profile</strong>s.</li>
<li><code>deploy</code>, <code>config</code>, and <code>benchmark</code> are separate <strong>Flow</strong>s.</li>
<li>Each flow tracks its own <code>flow_params.yaml</code>, <code>states_goal.yaml</code>, and <code>states_current.yaml</code></li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="flow-versioning"><a class="header" href="#flow-versioning">Flow Versioning</a></h1>
<p>A flow's version needs to be increased whenever:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item:</strong> An associated data type is changed -- <code>State</code>, <code>Diff</code>, <code>Params</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Flow:</strong> An item is added.</li>
<li><strong>Flow:</strong> An item is removed.</li>
<li><strong>Flow:</strong> An item is renamed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flow-version-maintenance"><a class="header" href="#flow-version-maintenance">Flow Version Maintenance</a></h2>
<p>For developers, maintaining multiple versions of flows is a cost, and usually one that is necessary. As items are created, modified, and removed throughout a flow's evolution, automation software needs to manage stored information from previous versions of the flow.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to manage and ship flow versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>One version:</strong> Only ship with one flow version.</p>
<p>Items never persist beyond the lifetime of the automation software.</p>
<p>Suitable for once off flows where ensure (and clean up) are done with the same version of the automation software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blue-green versioning:</strong> Ship with the previous and the next version.</p>
<p>Automation software is compatible with the previous version of each flow, as well as the next.</p>
<p>All stored information must be upgraded to the newer version before a new flow version is shipped.</p>
<p>Suitable for flows that do not evolve often, and not all previous versions of flows need to be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>n</code>-versioning:</strong> Ship with <code>n</code>-versions of flows.</p>
<p><code>n</code> may be all flows.</p>
<p>Each flow's state will need to adhere to the following, mainly for deserialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either never evolve its data type, or be an enum, with a variant per version / evolution.</li>
<li>Ship with upgrade code from old versions to the current version.
This is the highest cost in terms of code maintenance, and the shipped binary may grow unreasonably large over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flow-upgrades"><a class="header" href="#flow-upgrades">Flow Upgrades</a></h2>
<h3 id="upgrade-strategies"><a class="header" href="#upgrade-strategies">Upgrade Strategies</a></h3>
<p>For blue-green / <code>n</code> versioning, there are a number of strategies for upgrading stored information in the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic upgrade:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implementors and developers need to ship with <code>v1 -&gt; v2</code> migration code.</li>
<li>Simplest for users, assuming migration path is well understood / no surprises.</li>
<li>Developers may want to diff this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual upgrade:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implementors and developers need to ship with <code>v1 -&gt; v2</code> migration code.</li>
<li>Users have to choose to migrate.</li>
<li>Developers and users may want to diff things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>n</code>-versioning, upgrading from <code>v1 -&gt; v3</code> should use <code>v1 -&gt; v2 -&gt; v3</code>, so that developers don't have to write migration code form every version to the latest.</p>
<h2 id="execution-history"><a class="header" href="#execution-history">Execution History</a></h2>
<p>To render old either we have one standard format that doesn't need old data types to present, or we ship those types.</p>
<p>Makes sense to have a standard format -- shipping with previous data types creates bloat, and makes it impossible to support execution history for shipping single versions of flows.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="seamless-execution"><a class="header" href="#seamless-execution">Seamless Execution</a></h1>
<p>Seamless execution when multiple flow versions exist requires handling the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading and writing (serialization) stored state / outcomes from different flow versions.</li>
<li>Reading and writing to (adding, removing, modifying) the items from different flow versions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stored-state"><a class="header" href="#stored-state">Stored State</a></h2>
<p>Stored state is accessed when:</p>

<p>Same as manual item upgrade, except the upgrade command is not separate to the regular ensure command.</p>
<hr />
<p>For item upgrades, state could always be an enum, and <code>peace</code> doesn't include API support, constraints, or special handling for migrating between item versions -- the current building blocks are enough to implement seamless upgrades if items are implemented well.</p>
<p>For flow upgrades, we still need to handle clean up of old items no longer needed in subsequent flow versions, meaning the items must still be included in the development tool for their clean up logic.</p>
<p>For the developer, this could be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passing in the previous and current flow versions, and the framework working out which items need to be cleaned up.</li>
<li>Passing in the current flow version, and old items and params for the framework to clean up those items.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Is this enough to start working on <code>StatesSerde</code>?</p>
<p>Yes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>StatesSerde</code> should hold unknown entries (removed items).</li>
<li><code>States</code> should be mapped <code>From&lt;StatesSerde&gt;</code> after deserialization.</li>
<li>Users should be informed when there are unknown entries.</li>
<li><code>States</code> should be mapped <code>Into&lt;StatesSerde&gt;</code>, with an entry for each item in the flow.</li>

### Concept 9: Information Format
<p><strong>What:</strong> Change information format specifically for how it is consumed.</p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> Makes using the API ergonomic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Progress information can be more than a string.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For a human: output a progress bar, replace status text</li>
<li>For continuous integration: append status text</li>
<li>For a web request: output json</li>
</ul>

<p>Communicating Clearly In Code</p>

<div class="presentation_notes">
1. Today's talk is about empathetic code design.
<ol>
<li>
<p>The project I will use to demonstrate this is Peace, a framework to create empathetic and forgiving software automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace provides constraints over logic and data types, and common functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using the framework, logic and data types will be shaped to produce an automation tool that is clear in its communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user uses that tool to get their work done, with good user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's a 3 step process to upload a file to the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the file, create an S3 bucket, upload the file to that bucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can use a shell script to execute this process. <em>(live demo)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can also use a tool, created using the Peace framework, to do the same thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>envman</code> is a tool I created earlier to do this process. <em>(live demo)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a short demonstration of why one would use this framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When changing any environment, first we want to understand where we are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we also want to know, where we are headed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, we want to know the cost of getting there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, when we understand enough about the change, we can decide to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, when I say clear communication, it should be quite easy to see that A B C here maps to 1 2 3 there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By presenting information in the right form, at the right level of detail, it's much easier to map between the concept and what is seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is how Peace takes care of the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, we are going to look at how Peace takes care of the automation tool developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How clearly can we communicate between the mental model of a process, and code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When designing a flow, we need to define the items in the flow, and the ordering between those items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason these are called "items" instead of "steps", is because in Peace, the emphasis is on the outcome, rather than the actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Said another way, the purpose of technological processes is the end state, not the work undertaken to get there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That statement does not apply to other kinds of processes, where the work is meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In code, adding items and ordering looks like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This shows linear ordering; it is possible to have work done in parallel when there is no dependency between items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So here we can adjust the ordering such that A and B are both predecessors of C. A comes before C, and B comes before C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So A and B can both begin at the same time, reducing the overall duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We'll adjust this in the example, I want you to see that both the file download and the s3 bucket turn blue, and when both are done, then the upload begins. We'll slow down our connection so it is easier to see. <em>(live demo)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try doing that in a shell script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a developer defines the items in a flow, they also need to define how data passes through these items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've written automation using bash scripts or YAML, usually data is just strings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the non-devs among us, using "strings" everywhere is like saying, "I took stuff and did stuff, and here is stuff".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be much better to say, "I grab my camera, and took a shot, and here's a picture."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To better communicate with developers, Peace uses type safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Peace is a framework, each item's automation logic should be shareable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means, the input to each item, and its output, are API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Peace, we call the input "parameters", and we use call the output "state".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a file download item, the parameters are the source URL to download from and the path to write to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the state, can be either "the file's not there", or "it's there, and here is its content hash".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given each item defines its parameters and state, we need a way for developers to pass values into the parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, at the start of a process, we know the values of some parameters, and we can pass them straight in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, sometimes we need part of the process to be completed, to have the information to pass to a subsequent item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, if we had a server instead of an S3 bucket, we cannot know what its IP address will be until we the server is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we still want to encode into the flow, that the state from an earlier item, is needed to determine the parameter value for a subsequent item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the simple case, where we know the parameter values up front, we can just plug them in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we want to be able to express, "get the state from step two, and pass it into step three".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I came up with this, for every item's parameters, the framework will generate a specification type that records how to figure out what values to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and you can pass it direct values, or you can tell it "here's what states to read, and here's how to extract the value to use for this field".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's how it looks like in code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, we can read states from multiple items, and use them to compute a value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best of all, it's type safe -- so within the code you can ask "what parameters do I need to pass in, and get them right".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you make a mistake, you have a really big safety net called the compiler, that will save you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The error message needs improvement, though I haven't yet figured that out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the parameter type changes, such as when you upgrade your item version, then you get a compilation error, which means you don't have to work to discover where to change -- the compiler <em>tells you</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have our logic and our data, we need a way to interact with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace is designed to separate the automation logic and data, from how it is interacted with and presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether it is interactive shell, uninteractive shell, web API, or web page, there is no rendering code in any item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This allows automation developers to use different front ends to the same automation backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In code, the developer can choose which output to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently the only user facing output implementation is the <code>CliOutput</code>, which you've seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a number of other output implementations used in tests,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>such as the <code>NoOpOutput</code> which discards all information, and the <code>FnTrackerOutput</code> which stores what output methods were called, with what parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers can choose to write their own output implementation as well, but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is within the scope of Peace provide implementations for common use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So far, we've seen Items, Parameters, Specifications, and Output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer, this should be sufficient to run some commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First we group all of the above into a <code>CmdCtx</code>, then we call the command we want to run for the flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>StatesCurrentReadCmd</code> and <code>EnsureCmd</code> are provided by the framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The real code still contains code to format the output, but this is something that the framework can provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any automation software, the user should only need to pass in item parameters once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commands run using that flow should be able to recall parameters for the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we make this easy for the automation software developer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The easiest thing, is for them to do nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So whenever a command context is built, the following happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previous parameter specifications will attempt to be loaded from disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provided parameter specification will be merged with those.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validation happens, to make sure there is enough information to resolve parameters for all items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The merged parameter specifications will be serialized to disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the parameter specifications don't pass validation, we should get a useful error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a command is run, Peace stores information about that execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It stores this in a <code>.peace</code> directory within a workspace directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The automation tool developer needs to tell Peace how to determine the workspace directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because if the tool is run in a sub directory, information should still be stored in the workspace directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you think about git, if you run <code>git status</code> in any subdirectory of a repository, it will still find the <code>.git</code> directory somewhere up the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One undeniable way to tell if software works, is to run it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to tell if it will work in production, we usually want to run it in a replica environment first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out of the box, Peace provides support for logically separate environments, through profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So you can have multiple environments under different names, just like git branching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's see a demo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we communicate clearly in code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We make sure the API matches the mental model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We make sure we have good error messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we require something of the developer, make it easy for them to provide it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and when we adhere to these constraints, it will improve the automation development experience.</p>
</li>

1. Let's look at the deployment process, and we'll look at both manual and automatic executions.
2. In the manual execution, we ask our infrastructure team for some servers.
3. Upload the application to the server.
4. Set up the configuration.
5. Then start the application.
6. If we need to change the configuration, we can go back to this step, fix it, and restart the application.
7. If we have a new application version, we can go back to this step, upload it, maybe update the configuration for that new version, then start it.
8. In the automatic execution, we have some software that does all of the steps, and we feed parameters to that software.
9. The automation software may be a shell script, cloud automation tool, or something built in-house.
10. If we make a mistake with our parameters, we tend to have to wait for the execution to finish, clean up, and start again.
11. Wouldn't it be ideal, if we could say, "hey, finish what you're doing, but wait here."
12. Then we fix our parameters, press go, and have the automation start where it stopped.
13. There are two concepts here -- stopping and starting.
14. Interruptibility is about stopping safely, and resumability is about starting, where you stopped.
15. Let's get into it.

1. Imagine you're taking the bus, and you realize, you don't have your phone.
2. Some of you don't have to imagine.
3. There are 3 points where you may realize that you lost your phone:

    1. Before you get on the bus.
    2. While you are on the bus.
    3. After you get off the bus.

4. If you're not on the bus, that is, before you get on, or after you get off, it's safe to go and look for your phone.
5. But if you are on the bus, it is not safe to "just get off" -- it is moving.
6. To get off safely, the bus has to stop.
7. An interruption is when you signal the bus to stop.
8. We do this by pressing the stop button, and waiting for it to stop, and then we get off.
9. You don't just press the button, and jump off without waiting for the bus to stop. I have yet to see anyone do this.
10. Software that is not interruptible, is like a bus with only two stops -- the start and end.
11. So interrupting this kind of software is like jumping off the bus, as it is moving.
11. *Interruptible software* is introducing the stop button, and bus stops, to the software.
12. So people *can* press a button, wait for it to stop, and get off safely.

<!--
1. Automation software can be implemented for use on the command line, through a web interface, and as a desktop application.
2. This is significant because to support all three, you need to remember:
3. Command line tools tend to execute tasks on the main thread.
4. Web applications and desktop applications tend to execute tasks on a background thread.
5. Web applications listen for requests, and we need to map between the request and the execution, to interrupt it.
6. Desktop applications have an event loop to listen for user actions, and we need to map between the user action and the execution, to interrupt it.
7. If you want to support all these interfaces, don't use the operating system's interrupt signal as *the* interrupt signal.
8. What you should do is have an application level `InterruptSignal`.
9. And depending on how the automation logic is surfaced to the user, we translate between that usage and your interrupt signal.

1. Now that the user has sent us their intent to stop, we need to find a safe place to stop.
2. i.e. we need to build our bus stops.
3. We can of course insert interruption checks every so often.
4. So in this code, you can see that we check for interruptions before every step.
5. If our steps do a lot of work, we can pass the interrupt signal receiver down to each step if necessary.

<!--
1. Reporting is about what we tell the caller of our code, alongside what they asked.
2. Normally when we write code, we return the value that the code is meant to compute.
3. When we write interruptible software, we're not only returning a value, but also reporting on what happened.
4. In this basic `Outcome`, we return the value if the execution is complete, or we tell the caller that we were interrupted, so there is no value to return.
5. We can be more informative, by collecting the values produced by each step, and if we are interrupted, we return those values within our response.
6. Finally, we can also keep track of the steps that we have executed, and steps that we have not executed, and include that in our response.
7. All of this is in preparation for, if we want to resume execution, we have enough information to restart, where we last stopped.

1. Think back to the bus example.
2. What if, we want to press the stop button, but we want the bus to stop not at the immediate next stop, but a number of stops down the line.
3. Like before you get on the bus, you schedule that you want the bus to stop 8 stops away -- because that's where your workplace is.
4. That way, you don't have to be alert to press the stop button just before your stop.
5. When writing complex automation with hundreds of steps, this is what we want to for testing.

<!--
1. To implement interruptibility, we start with the non-interruptible logic.
2. And we saw earlier we could sprinkle interruptibility checks before each step.
3. But we've lost clarity.
4. Can we do "better"?
5. Yes we can.
6. We can implement interruptibility, without sacrificing maintainability.

1. Resumability is about starting, where you stopped.
2. If the work is already done, why do it again.
3. If you've paid the cost once, why pay it again, and again, and again!
4. This not only benefits end users, it benefits developers when they are testing the automation software.
5. We often talk about having a faster feedback loop. This is it.

<summary>6. <code>MultiProfile</code> Cmd scope profile sort function</summary>
<div>
Users may want to sort profiles in the profile directory differently to their alphabetical / lexicographical sorting.
<p>This may be dependent on profile params – sort env based on env type, last execution time – profile history.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>7. Cancel-safe state storage</summary>
<div>
When an item ensure does multiple writes, there is a possibility of not all of those writes occur during execution:
<ul>
<li>user interrupts the execution.</li>
<li>internet connection drops.</li>
<li>machine loses power.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last case, we cannot safely write state to disk, so a <code>StateCurrent</code> discover is needed to bring <code>StatesCurrentStored</code> up to date. However, the previous two cases, it is possible for <code>Item</code>s to return <code>State</code> that has been partially ensured, without making any further outgoing calls -- i.e. infer <code>StatesEnsured</code> based on the successful writes so far.</p>
<p>Note that this places a burden on the <code>Item</code> implementor to return the partial state ensured (which may conflict with keeping the <code>State</code> simple), as well as make the <code>ApplyFns::exec</code> return value more complex.</p>
<p>The trade off may not be worthwhile.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>8. Adding / removing / modifying items in flows</summary>
<div>
Implementors may add/remove/modify items in flows.
<p>Peace needs to be designed such that these changes do not cause already-existent flows to not be loadable, i.e. when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>states_*.yaml</code> contains state for which an item no longer exists in the flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>states_*.yaml</code> does not contain state for an item that is newly added to the flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>states_*.yaml</code> contains state whose fields are different to a new version of an item.</p>
<p>This one can be addressed by having <code>State</code> be an enum, with versioned variants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see 14.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>9. Item expiry</summary>
<div>
For items that cost, it is useful to have an expiry time that causes it to be deleted.
<ul>
<li>This would have to be supported by the service that hosts the item.</li>
<li>There should be a way to notify the user of items that are about to expire.</li>
<li>There should also be a way to extend the item expiry times easily.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>10. Interrupt / cancel safety</summary>
<div>
The [`tokio-graceful-shutdown`] library can be used to introduce interrupt safety into item executions. This is particularly useful for write functions.
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-graceful-shutdown/latest/tokio_graceful_shutdown/struct.SubsystemHandle.html#method.is_shutdown_requested"><code>is_shutdown_requested</code></a> method in particular.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>11. Diffable item params</summary>
<div>
`DiffCmd` originally was written to diff the current and goal states. However, with the second use case of "diff states between two profiles", it is also apparent that other related functionality is useful:
<ul>
<li>Diff profile params / flow params.</li>
<li>Diff item params between profiles for a given flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of diffable params, and [#94], the <code>Item</code> should likely have:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>type Params: ItemParams + Serialize + DeserializeOwned</code>.</li>
<li>feature gated <code>fn item_params_diff(..)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>fn item_params_diff(..)</code> should likely have a similar signature to <code>fn state_diff(..)</code>, whereby if one uses  <code>XData&lt;'_&gt;</code>, the other should as well for consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>MultiProfileSingleFlow</code> commands, a diff for item params which contains a referential value (e.g. "use the <code>some_predecessor.ip_address()</code>") may(?) need information about <code>some_predecessor</code> through <code>Resources</code> / <code>Data</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We should work out the design of that before settling on what <code>state_diff</code> and <code>item_params_diff</code>'s function parameters will be. See <strong>Design Thoughts</strong> on [#94] for how it may look like.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>12. Default item params</summary>
<div>
An `Item`'s params may not necessarily be mandatory. From the `Params` type (and corresponding trait), Peace may:
<ul>
<li>Insert default param values, if the <code>Item</code> implementor provides a default</li>
<li>Still make the params required if there is no default.</li>
<li>Provide a way for <code>ParamsSpec</code> for each field to be the default, or a mapping function.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>13. Upgrades: Tolerate optional or different workspace params / item params / states</summary>
<div>
When new workspace params are added, or new items are added to a flow, existing `*_params.yaml`, `item_params.yaml`, and `states_*.yaml` may not contain values for those newly added params / items.
<p>Automation software should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with missing parameters.</li>
<li>Work with changed parameter types.</li>
</ul>
<p>When workspace params / items are removed from a flow, leftover params / state are no longer used. However, we may want to do one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notify the user to clean up unused params</li>
<li>Peace should ignore it</li>
<li>Inform the automator to still register the item, so that old execution may be loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>14. Store params per execution, pass previous execution's params to clean cmd</summary>
<div>
Instead of requiring `Item::State` to store the params used when applied, maybe we should store the params used in the last ensure alongside that item's state.
<p>Users are concerned with the current state of the item. They also may be concerned with the parameters used to produce that state. Requiring item implementors to store paths / IP addresses within the state that has been ensured feels like unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p>However, when comparing diffs, we would hope either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The params used to discover the current and goal states are the same, or</li>
<li>The "params and states" pairs are both compared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>apply_check</code> needs to have both the old and new params to determine whether apply needs to be executed.</li>
<li><code>State</code> as the output API, should not necessarily include params.</li>
<li>When parameters change, and an apply is interrupted, then we may have earlier items using the new parameters, and later items still on the previous parameters. More complicated still, is if parameters change <em>in the middle of an interruption</em>, and re-applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps there should be a <code>(dest_parameters, Item::State)</code> current state, and a <code>(src_parameters, Item::State)</code> goal state. That makes sense for file downloads if we care about cleaning up the previous <code>dest_path</code>, to move a file to the new <code>dest_path</code>.</p>
<p>Or, all dest parameters should be in <code>Item::State</code>, because that's what's needed to know if something needs to change.</p>
<p>Another thought:</p>
<p><code>states_*.yaml</code> should store this per item:</p>
<ul>
<li>params used for apply</li>
<li>values resolved for those params</li>
<li>current state</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see 8.</p>

<summary>16. Combine <code>data</code> and <code>params{,_partial}</code> into <code>FnCtx</code></summary>
<div>
`Item` functions take in `FnCtx`, `data`, and item `params` as separate arguments.
<p>This was done to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the additional layer to get <code>Item::Params</code>, or <code>Item::ParamsPartial</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid progress sender from being passed in to function that didn't need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, functions don't necessarily need runtime <code>fn_ctx</code> or <code>data</code>, making it noise in the signature.</p>
<p>Should we combine all 3 into <code>FnCtx</code>? It would make <code>FnCtx</code> type parameterized over <code>Params</code> and <code>ParamsPartial</code>.</p>
</div>

<summary>17. Style edges / items red when an error occurs.</summary>
<div>
When we hit an error, can we go through parameters / states to determine whether the error is to do with an item itself, or a link between the item and its predecessor?
<p>Then style that link red.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>18. Markdown text instead of <code>Presentable</code>.</summary>
<div>
Instead of requiring developers to `impl Presentable for` all the different types that use, and use different `Presentable` methods, we could require them to implement `Display`, using a markdown string.
<p>Then, for different <code>OutputWrite</code> implementations, we would do something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CliOutput</code>: <code>syntect</code> highlight things.</li>
<li><code>WebiOutput</code>: Use commonmark to generate HTML elements, and with 19, use that as part of each item node's content.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>19. HTML with SVG arrows and flexbox instead of <code>dot</code>.</summary>
<div>
Instead of using `dot`, we just use flexbox and generate arrows between HTML `div`s.
<p>This trades</p>

<div>
1. Referential lookup of values in state / item params. ([\#94])
<ol>
<li>
<p>AWS SDK is not WASM ready -- includes <code>mio</code> unconditionally through <code>tokio</code> (calls UDP). (<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/59">aws-sdk-rust#59</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS SDK does not always include error detail -- S3 <code>head_object</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/227">aws-sdk-rust#227</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progress output should enable-able for state current / goal discover / clean functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flow params are annoying to register every time we add another item. Maybe split end user provided params from item params.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blank item needs a lot of rework to be easier to implement an item. ([67], [#96])</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <code>ApplyCmd</code>, collect <code>StateCurrent</code>, <code>StateGoal</code>, <code>StateDiff</code> in execution report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS errors' <code>code</code> and <code>message</code> should be shown to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progress limit should not be returned in <code>ApplyFns::check</code>, but sent through <code>progress_sender.limit(ProgressLimit)</code>. This simplifies <code>check</code>, and allows state current/goal discovery to set the limits easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidate <code>StatesDiscoverCmd</code> and <code>ApplyCmd</code>, so the outcome of a command is generic. Maybe use a trait and structs, instead of enum variants and hardcoded inlined functions, so that it is extendable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an <code>ListKeysAligned</code> presentable type so <code>Presenter</code>s can align keys of a list dynamically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the <code>peace_cfg::State</code> type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contextual presentable strings, for states and diffs.</p>
<p>What command is this called for:</p>
<ul>
<li>state current: "is .."</li>
<li>goal state: "should be .."</li>
<li>diff between current and goal: "will change from .. to .."</li>
<li>diff between current and cleaned: "will change from .. to .."</li>
<li>diff between two profiles' current states: : "left is .., right is .."
Maybe we don't burden the presenter implementation, but Peace will insert the contextual words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy API functions for diffing -- current vs goal, between profiles' current states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about diffing states of different state versions?</p>
<p>Maybe this is already taken care of -- <code>state_diff</code> is already passed in both <code>State</code>s, so implementors had to manage it already.</p>

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.
   
   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.
   
   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

1. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that You changed the files; and
   
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
   the Derivative Works; and
   
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

1. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

1. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that You changed the files; and

   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
   the Derivative Works; and
   
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

1. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   and conversions to other media types.
   
   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that You changed the files; and
   
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
   the Derivative Works; and
   
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

1. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.
   
   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.
   
   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

1. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that You changed the files; and
   
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
   the Derivative Works; and
   
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

1. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

   the Derivative Works; and
   
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

1. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that You changed the files; and
   
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
   the Derivative Works; and
   
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

1. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

1. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
   as modifying the License.
   
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

1. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

1. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

1. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

2. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

2. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>
<p>"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>
<p>"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation
source, and configuration files.</p>
<p>"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
and conversions to other media types.</p>
<p>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>
<p>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</p>
<p>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
